                    I've been programming computers for a long time. Since I was 5 years old, in fact. Of course, back then I wasn't versed in Object Oriented code, Object Calisthenics, Single Responsibility Principle, or how much caffeine is safe in a single day. (Spoiler: Less than I normally drink.)

                    These days I'm making the world a better place by improving Maine's ability to access the news, while also focusing on finding ways to teach the next generation of software developers. Whether that's through private mentoring, or teaching kids how to code.

                    I am a largely self-taught developer, and that tends to find me learning as many new technologies as I can get my hands &mdash; or brain &mdash; around. My work life has me focused on WordPress development, so in my spare time I try other things.

                    What have I been up to lately? Not much, just learning how to write code for Laravel and Vue.js. I've also been trying to improve my website design skills by digging deep into Tailwind CSS and as many "Design for Developers" courses as I can find.

                    Have you ever woken up one day and realized you've spent the last 6 years
                    doing code every day, and you're not able to show anybody any of it because
                    that code is owned by the company you work for?

                    Oh well, when I realized that I knew I needed to do something about it.
                    I love code, but I also love the problems we're solving in the news.
                    That lead me to not doing a lot of non-work code.

                    Not anymore. As I explain to the people I teach, you can read all you want
                    but you don't really learn anything about code until you start writing it.
                    So I started writing it.

                        I absolutely love logic puzzles, so it was without hesitation that I tackled
                        rewriting <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.com/" rel="nofollow" alt="Gabrielle Cirulli's website">Gabriele Cirulli's</a>
                        2048 with Vue.js. This project didn't go off without a hitch, though.
                        It was my first major Vue project, and I had to learn a lot about how
                        the reactive components worked together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">
                        Building the board itself was simple enough using Flexbox. The trouble
                        started with how I originally planned to handle adding tiles to the board.
                        As tiles were merged, I was increasing the value of one tile, and destroying
                        the other tile. But because of how Vue treats array based reactive components,
                        things started to jump around the board with the CSS animations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">
                        I ended up solving this problem by maintaining an array of all tiles to ever
                        be added to the board, and flipping a "visible" flag on them as they were merged.
                        This allowed me to hide them from the board, without disrupting the index.
                    </p>

                        Note about the design: I did a near exact clone of the design to start, as I wanted
                        my focus to be solely on the mechanics of the game. I have plans to go back and customize
                        the design down the road.

                        I built this Pomodoro / To-Do list app for two reasons: First, it was a good way to learn Vue.js and design, and second, I actually use it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">
                        I was looking for a pomodoro clock that I could put my to-do list into, and I kept finding ones full of ads, or that didn't work for me for one reason or another. So I decided that I would make this one of my portfolio projects and release it on Github.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">
                        The design was completed using Figma. I designed it for mobile. I didn't want to build a desktop design because I feel the simplicity of the Pomodoro technique should be reflected in the design itself. For that reason there isn't a whole lot going on with the design.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">
                        It uses Vue.js to handle the responsive elements, and local storage to maintain state between refreshes. Future versions may include a Todoist integration, but for now I like the simple version.
